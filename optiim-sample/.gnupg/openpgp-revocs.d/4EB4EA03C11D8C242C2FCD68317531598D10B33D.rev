This is a revocation certificate for the OpenPGP key:

pub   rsa2048 2020-04-01 [S]
      4EB4EA03C11D8C242C2FCD68317531598D10B33D
uid          Continuous Software C.I. (Helm Chart Signing GPG keys) <cs-infrastructure@continuoussoftware.ie>

A revocation certificate is a kind of "kill switch" to publicly
declare that a key shall not anymore be used.  It is not possible
to retract such a revocation certificate once it has been published.

Use it to revoke this key in case of a compromise or loss of
the secret key.  However, if the secret key is still accessible,
it is better to generate a new revocation certificate and give
a reason for the revocation.  For details see the description of
of the gpg command "--generate-revocation" in the GnuPG manual.

To avoid an accidental use of this file, a colon has been inserted
before the 5 dashes below.  Remove this colon with a text editor
before importing and publishing this revocation certificate.
